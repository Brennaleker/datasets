# Datasets

These are datasets that I've created, cleaned up, or compiled from public sources.

## Pomological

This is a listing of the images in the Pomological Watercolors Collection housed in the US Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Library. A version of this dataset powers [the @pomological twitter bot](https://twitter.com/pomological). [David Riordan](https://twitter.com/riordan) helped with the initial scraping.

## NYC neighborhoods

There are a bunch of problems with using ZIP codes as geographical boundaries, but if you want to throw caution to the wind, this is a set of named neighborhoods in New York City and some corresponding ZIP codes. It is a little stale and could use an update, but here it is.

## Dogs

Collected information about registered dogs in different cities (currently New York and San Francisco). These are snapshots of the registration database obtained through public records requests, which I've converted to JSON. Each city provides slightly different information, but names, breeds, and zip codes are pretty constant.

These are datasets that I've created, cleaned up, or compiled from public sources.

This is a listing of the images in the Pomological Watercolors Collection housed in the US Department of Agriculture's National Agricultural Library. A version of this dataset powers [the @pomological twitter bot](https://twitter.com/pomological).
